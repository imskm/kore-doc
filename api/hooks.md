# Hooks

Kore supports several hooking functions allowing your application
to do things at certain times in the Kore startup / shutdown procedure.

The prototypes for these are found in the kore/hooks.h header file.

```
#include <kore/hooks.h>
```

* [kore\_parent\_configure](#parentconfigure)
* [kore\_parent\_daemonized](#parentdaemonized)
* [kore\_parent\_teardown](#parentteardown)
* [kore\_worker\_configure](#workerconfigure)
* [kore\_worker\_teardown](#workerteardown)
* [kore\_python\_preinit](#pythonpreinit)

# kore\_worker\_configure {#workerconfigure}
