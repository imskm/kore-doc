# Python

This page contains a reference of all exported Kore functions to Python.

Kore must be compiled with **PYTHON=1** for this to work.
Python 3.6 or higher should be used.

# A Kore Python application

Since the 4.0.0 release you can use Kore as an asynchronous first
Python web development platform.

Completely configurable via code and easy to setup and write.

A Kore Python application must be setup in the following way:

* Import kore.
* Define a class with a configure() method.
* Instanciate the koreapp global with that class.

The configure() method is called at startup by the Kore platform and
will receive a list of arguments passed to the command-line.

From there you can configure Kore via the kore.config object, create
server contexts and setup domains and routes.

Note that the Python code is expected to run inside of the Kore worker
process, the kore module being imported is not available outside of
this worker process.

Example:

```python
import kore

class MyApp:
    def configure(self, args):
        kore.config.workers = 1
        kore.config.deployment = "dev"

        kore.server("notls", ip="127.0.0.1", port="8888", tls=False)

        domain = kore.domain("*", attach="notls")
        domain.route("/", self.index, methods=["get"])
        domain.route("^/(0-9)$", self.index_with_args, methods=["get"])

    def index(self, req):
        req.response(200, b'hello')

    def index_with_args(self, req, specified_id):
        req.response(200, specified_id)

koreapp = MyApp()
```

# Kore {#koremodule}

## Configuration {#koreconfig}

Kore configuration options can be set via the kore.config module.

All options available in the traditional kore configuration be
set via the Python code.

| Configuration option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| root | The root path in which the Kore server runs (either via chroot or chdir). If not set, the current working directory. |
| runas | The user the worker processes will run as. If not set, the current user. |
| workers | The number of worker processes to use. If not set, the number of CPU cores in the system. |
| worker\_max\_connections | The maximum number of active connections a worker process holds before refusing to accept more. |
| worker\_rlimit\_nofiles | The maximum number of open file descriptor per worker. |
| worker\_accept\_threshold | The maximum number of new connections to accept in a single event loop. |
| worker\_death\_policy | The death policy for a worker, "restart" by default. If set to "terminate" will cause the Kore server to shutdown on abnormal worker termination. |
| worker\_set\_affinity | Worker CPU affinity (0 or 1, default 1). |
| pidfile | The path to a file in which the server will write the PID for the parent process. |
| socket\_backlog | The number of pending connections. |
| tls\_version | The TLS version to use (default: both, 1.2 for TLSv1.2 only and 1.3 for TLSv1.3 only). |
| tls\_cipher | OpenSSL ciphersuite list to use. Defaults to a very sane list with only AEAD ciphers and ephemeral key exchanges. |
| tls\_dhparam | Path to DH parameters for the server to use. |
| rand\_file | Path to a 2048 byte file containing entropy used to seed the PRNG. |
| keymgr\_runas | The user the keymgr process will run as. If not set, the current user. |
| keymgr\_root | The root path for the keymgr process. If not set, inherited from the root option. |
| acme\_runas | The user the acme process will run as. If not set, the current user. |
| acme\_root | The root path for the acme process. If not set, inherited from the root option. |
| acme\_email | An email adress used for account registration. |
| acme\_provider | A URL to the directory for an ACME provider. Defaults to Let's Encrypt. |
| pledge | OpenBSD only, pledge categories for the worker processes. |
| seccomp\_tracing | Linux only, seccomp violations will be logged and not cause the process to terminate. Either "yes" or "no". |
| filemap\_ext | The default extension for files in a filemap. |
| filemap\_index | The root file in a filemap. (eg index.html). |
| http\_media\_type | Add a new HTTP media type (in the form of "mediatype ext1 ext2 ext"). |
| http\_header\_max | The maximum number of bytes HTTP headers can consist of. If a request comes in with headers larger than this the connection is closed. Defaults to 4096 bytes. |
| http\_header\_timeout | The number of seconds after which Kore will close a connection if no HTTP headers were received. Defaults to 10. |
| http\_body\_max | The maximum number of bytes an HTTP body can consist of. If a request comes in with a body larger than this the connection is closed with a 413 response. Defaults to 1MB. |
| http\_body\_timeout | The number of seconds after which Kore will close a connection if no HTTP body was received in full. Defaults to 60. |
| http\_body\_disk\_offload | The number in bytes from which point Kore will offload incoming HTTP bodies onto a file on disk instead of keeping it in memory. Disabled by default. |
| http\_body\_disk\_path | A path where the temporary body files are written if the http\_body\_disk\_offload setting is enabled. |
| http\_server\_version | Allows you to override the Kore server header. |
| http\_pretty\_error | If set to "yes" will display HTML based HTTP error codes. Defaults to "no". |
| deployment | The deployment type of the application. Either "production" or "development". The production setting will cause Kore to chroot and drop privileges and run in the background. The development setting will run Kore in the foreground and only chdir into the root setting. |

Any configuration options should be set in your App.configure method.

Example

```python
import os
import kore

class MyApp:
    def configure(self, args):
        kore.config.workers = 1
        kore.config.http_header_max = 1024
        kore.config.http_header_timeout = 60
        kore.config.seccomp_tracing = "yes"
        kore.config.deployment = os.getenv("DEPLOYMENT", default="dev")

```

```

---

## Asynchronous HTTP client {#httpclient}

The Python API in Kore contains a full asynchronous HTTP client that allows
you to fire off HTTP requests from your Python code and await their result.

Before you can use the client you must set it up.

**note** Kore must be built with CURL=1 for the httpclient to be included.

```python
client = kore.httpclient(url, keywords)
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| url | The URL to send the request to. |

Addiotnally, optional keyword parameters can be specified:

| Keywords | Description |
| --- | --- |
| tlscert | A path to an x509 certificate to be used to authenticate this request. |
| tlskey | A path to the private key to be used to authenticate this request. |
| tlsverify | Should the peer its x509 certificate be verified (default: True). |
| cabundle | A path to a PEM bundle containing the CAs you would like to use to verify the peer. |
| unix | Use this unix socket path instead (On Linux if prefixed with '@' this becomes an abstract socket path. |

Kore internally will re-use connections to the same hosts if they are
available, as a developer you can go ahead and create multiple httpclient
objects to the same host, they will all share underlying connections.

Once the httpclient object is created you can call any of the following
functions on it to perform the requested action (these calls return a coroutine and must be awaited):

* get
* put
* post
* head
* patch
* delete
* options

| Keywords | Description |
| --- | --- |
| body | For put, post and patch, add the given bytes as the HTTP body. |
| headers | A dictionary containing the headers to be added to the request. |
| return\_headers | Set to True to return the headers as well (default: False). |

Unless the return\_headers keyword is True, these functions return a tuple
containing the status and HTTP body. If return\_headers is True, the tuple
returned will be status, headers, HTTP body.

### Example

```python
client = kore.httpclient("https://kore.io")

# Do a normal GET request.
status, body = await client.get()

# Do a POST.
mybody = "Hello world"
status, body = await client.post(
	body=mybody.encode("utf-8"),
	headers={
		"x-header": "from-client"
	}
)

# Get the headers from a GET request.
status, headers, body = await client.get(return_headers=True)
```

---

## Asynchronous libcurl client {#curl}

The Python API in Kore contains a full asynchronous libcurl client that allows
you to fire off any protocol that libcurl supports from your Python code and
await their result.

Before you can use the client you must set it up.

**note** Kore must be built with CURL=1 for the curl handler to be included.

---

# Creating a new curl handle {#curlhandle}

### Synopsis

```python
handle = kore.curl(url)
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| url | The URL to send the request to. |

Once the libcurl object is created you can call handle.run() to perform
the call to the specified url.

Additionally you can call handle.setopt() which behaves a lot like
the curl\_easy\_setopt() function.
### Example

```python
handle = kore.curl("https://kore.io")

# Run the libcurl handle.
data = await handle.run()
```

---

# Using libcurl setopt from Python {#curlsetopt}

### Synopsis

```python
handle.setopt(option, value)
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| option | The libcurl option to be set. |
| value | The value to set the option to. |

All libcurl constants are exported under the kore module directly.

Example:
```python
handle = kore.curl("https://kore.io")
handle.setopt(kore.CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 10)
```

Depending on what the original option in libcurl takes the value must
either be a string, an integer or a list.

### Returns

Nothing

### Example

```python
def onmessage(c, op, data):
	kore.websocket_broadcast(c, op, data, kore.WEBSOCKET_BROADCAST_GLOBAL)
```

# Async/await {#async}

Kore exposes several functions that can be awaited upon allowing you to
write concurrent page handlers without any callbacks.

Kore currently supports:

  * [Sockets](#asyncsocket)
  * [Locks](#asynclock)
  * [Queues](#asyncqueue)
  * [Processes](#asyncproc)

For example code covering all asynchronous features, please see the
[python-async](https://github.com/jorisvink/kore/tree/master/examples/python-async) example.

You may choose to create new coroutines using <a href="#taskcreate">task_create</a> or await several coroutines using <a href="#gather">gather</a>.

## Asynchronous sockets {#asyncsocket}

You can use an existing Python socket object and wrap it inside of a Kore
socket. When you have a wrapped socket you can connect/accept, send or recv
asynchronously.

* [recv](#socketrecv)
* [recvfrom](#socketrecvfrom)
* [send](#socketsend)
* [sendto](#socketsendto)
* [accept](#socketaccept)
* [connect](#socketconnect)
* [close](#socketclose)

Example:

```python
import kore
import socket

async def page(req):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM |
                                         socket.SOCK_NONBLOCK)

    # Wrap the socket in a Kore object.
    ksock = kore.socket_wrap(sock)

    # Connect and send some data.
    await ksock.connect("127.0.0.1", 3332)
    await ksock.send("hello world")

    # Read a response.
    response = await ksock.recv(1024)

    ksock.close()
    sock.close()
```

---

### sock.recv {#socketrecv}

### Synopsis

```python
data = await sock.recv(1024)
```

### Description

Reads up to **maxlen** bytes from the socket. The optional **timeout** argument

read from the socket. If no timeout argument is specified, the call will wait
until data is available.


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| maxlen | Maximum number of bytes to be read. |
| timeout | Optional timeout in milliseconds. |

### Returns

The bytes read as a byte object or None on EOF.

### Example

```python
data = await sock.recv(1024)
if data is None:
    printf("eof!")
else:
    print("received %s" % data)

# Use optional timeout argument
try:
    data = await sock.recv(1024, 1000)
except TimeoutError as e:
    print("timed out reading (%s)" % e)
```

---

### sock.recvfrom {#socketrecvfrom}

A tuple of (address, data) for AF\_UNIX.

None on EOF.

### Example

```python
ip, port, data = await sock.recvfrom(1024)
if data is None:
    printf("eof!")
else:
    await sock.sendto(ip, port, data)
```

```

---

### sock.sendto {#socketsendto}

### Synopsis

```python
await sock.sendto(address, port, data)
```

```

---

### sock.accept {#socketaccept}

### Synopsis

```python
await sock.accept()
```

### Description

Accepts a new connection on the socket.

## Locks {#asynclock}

Kore provides a locking mechanism where multiple coroutines can wait
upon a lock in a non-blocking way. This allows synchronization between
coroutines in a straight forward way.

A lock is created by calling **kore.lock()**.

An coroutine can use the lock with the Python "async with" syntax.

Example:

```python
# Create the lock
lock = kore.lock()

async def request(req):
	# Only allow one request at a time to this handler.
	async with lock:
		# do things
		req.response(200, b'ok')
```

---

## Queues {#asyncqueue}

Kore provides a queue system that allows objects to be sent back and forth
between coroutines in a non-blocking fashion.

The queue is a FIFO queue.

* [push](#queuepush)
* [pop](#queuepop)
* [popnow](#queuepopnow)

---

### queue.push {#queuepush}

### Synopsis

```python
queue.push(object)
```

### Description

Pushes the given **object** onto the queue. The coroutine that waited first
on the queue using **pop** will be woken up.

| Parameter | Description |

| object | The object to be pushed onto the queue. |

### Returns

Nothing.

### Example

```python
queue = kore.queue()

d = {
    "foo": "bar"
}

queue.push(d)
```

---

### queue.pop {#queuepop}

### Synopsis

```python
object = await queue.pop()
